abstract = {This paper proposes a bias detection method in the voltage measurement of lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery cells to identify faulty sensor(s). The proposed method is based on a Bayesian probabilistic approach that detects possible measurement bias in any battery cell in real-time. A hypothesis bank is constructed for possible bias magnitudes in each cell. Subsequently, the fault detection algorithm computes the probability associated with all hypotheses. Once the probability of a certain hypothesis converges to unity, the faulty sensor and its associated bias are identified. The quantified bias can then be compensated in the measurement model of the associated cell. Details on the proposed method followed by experimental verification using commercial lithium-ion battery datasets are provided.},

abstract = {This paper researches a suitable mathematical model that can reliably predict the release of a model drug (namely calcein) from biologically targeted liposomal nanocarriers triggered by ultrasound. Using mathematical models, curve fitting is performed on a set of five experimental acoustic drug release runs from Albumin-, Estrone-, and RGD-based Drug Delivery Systems (DDS). The three moieties were chosen to target specific cancers using receptor-mediated endocytosis. The best-fitting mathematical model is then enhanced using a Kalman filtering (KF) algorithm to account for the statistics of the dynamic and measurements noise sequences in predicted drug release. Unbiased drug-release estimates are realized by implementing an online noise identification algorithm. The algorithm is first deployed in a simulated environment in which it was rigorously tested and compared with the correct solution. Then, the algorithm was used to process the five experimental datasets. The results suggest that the Adaptive Kalman Filter (AKF) is exceptionally good at handling drug release estimation problems with a priori unknown or with changing noise covariances. In comparison with the KF, the AKF approach exhibited as low as a 69{\%} reduction in the level of error in estimating the drug release state. Finally, the proposed algorithm is not computationally demanding and is capable of online estimation tasks.},

abstract = {Real-time battery state-of-charge (SOC) estimation is critical in many applications. The extended Kalman filter (EKF) has been successfully deployed in SOC estimation allowing real-time SOC monitoring. However, modeling inaccuracies, measurement faults, and wrong initialization can cause the estimation algorithm to diverge. The precise knowledge of statistical information about process and measurements noise is crucial for accurate system modeling and estimation. This paper presents a novel SOC estimation approach based on maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE). The process and measurements models are transformed to an error state propagation system where the innovation covariance is utilized to maximize the likelihood of the multivariate innovation distribution with respect to process and measurement covariances. The MLE formulation allows the estimation of the process and measurement noise covariance magnitudes, which are used to obtain an optimal SOC estimate. The proposed method is validated experimentally using a number of Li-ion battery cells under various testing conditions. The estimation performance is compared with that of the conventional EKF technique as well as previously published results based on autocovariance least-squares measurements noise estimation. The results indicate an enhanced performance for the new algorithm over the traditional EKF across all conducted tests.},

abstract = {This work describes an adaptive trajectory tracking controller for underactuated underwater vehicles. The control design process is two-fold; first, a high-level kinematic controller is designed to produce velocity commands that steer the vehicle towards the desired trajectory, and second, a low-level controller is designed to utilize the mathematical model of the vehicle to produce force and torque commands for the thrusters onboard the underwater vehicle. A novel adaptive Nussbaum-function-based controller is proposed and compared with an adaptive proportional controller with integral feedback. Further, a conditional adaptation scheme is developed to combat effects of noise, disturbance, or uncertainty. The proposed scheme governs adaptation such that the gains only adapt when it is necessary, even in the presence of noise. The target vehicle for the controller is a four-thruster quadcopter-like vehicle, which does not have direct control over all degrees of freedom. The issue of having an underactuated thruster arrangement is common in many classes of inspection robots. The devised adaptive control law exhibits fast convergence for the adaptation. Four different parametrized trajectories are tested, and the performance of the proposed algorithms, when considering the tracking errors and required control effort, is shown to be superior to an adaptive proportional controller.},

abstract = {This paper models the acoustic drug release of chemotherapeutics from liposomes using a kinetic model that accounts for systematic biases affecting the drug delivery process. An optimal stochastic filter is then proposed to provide robust estimates of the percent drug released. Optimality is guaranteed by accurately identifying the underlying statistical noise characteristics in experimental data. The estimator also quantifies the bias in the release, exhibited by the experimental data. Drug release is experimentally measured as a change in fluorescence upon the application of ultrasound. First, a first-order kinetic model is proposed to model the release, which is aided by a bias term to account for the fact that full release is not achieved under the conditions explored in this study. The noise structure affecting the process dynamics and the measurement process is then identified in terms of the statistical covariance of the measured quantities. The identified covariance magnitudes are then utilized to estimate the dynamics of drug release as well as the bias term. The identified a priori knowledge is used to implement an optimal Kalman filter, which was initially tested in a simulation environment. The experimental datasets are then fed into the filter to estimate the state and identify the bias. Experiments span a number of ultrasonic power densities for liposomes. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm, the optimal Kalman filter, performs well in modeling acoustically activated drug release from liposomes.},

Quaternions are employed to describe the attitude of the vehicle to avoid the singularity associated with the Euler angles based formulation. The finite element analysis package ANSYS is used to identify the drag and added inertia parameters that affect the vehicle.

The only external force applied to the model is the weight. An experimental setup is used to validate the obtained models. The simulated time response of the system is compared to the experimental one. A good agreement between the two results is obtained. A frequency analysis of the response is then performed, which showed the existence of different harmonics depending on the initial angular position. Some differences are noticed, however, between the experimental results and those obtained through the simulation. These differences could be attributed to the chosen values of the viscous and dry friction parameters.
